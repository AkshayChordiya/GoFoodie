# GoFoodie
GoFoodie is an extremely simple tool which suggests what food items to cook ðŸ˜‹

# Why this tool?

The idea came to me because my mom constantly asks me what to cook everyday and then my
dad suggested me to ask this question Google (Using OK, Google!) and that's how
**GoFoodie** was born

# Usage (Newbiees)

1. Download the `yummy.json` (It contains food items)
* Download the `gofoodie.exe`

After that whenever you need suggestion for food item, just run `gofoodie.exe`

# Future Development

Still deciding but have plans to build this tool using **API.ai** platform
